== Maven Repo

=== Download Access

The maven repo for DOWNLOAD use is:

`https://mvn.fulcrologic.com`

It uses auth which is stored in a postgresql database. The username for that database
is grp, and the table is users. We will need to write an admin app that can run
to maintain this db. Users must have a username/password in this database
in order to use the repo.


Deps:

[source, clojure]
-----
{:mvn/repos {"fulcrologic" {:url "https://mvn.fulcrologic.com"}}
 ...}
-----

And in `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

[source, xml]
-----

<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>fulcrologic</id>
            <username>tony@fulcrologic.com</username>
            <password>password</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
-----

=== Upload Access

Auth is controlled by `/etc/nginx/mvn.htpasswd`. The upload URL is `https://mvn.fulcrologic.com/mvn`. The pom.xml
contains the right distro settings in GRP.

`mvn deploy` will do the right thing if you have proper credentials in `settings.xml`.

[source, xml]
-----
<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>fulcrologic-publish</id>
            <username>tony</username>
            <password>publish password</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
