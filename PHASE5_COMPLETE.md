# Phase 5: Error Formatting - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE with zero regressions

## Overview

Enhanced error messages to display execution path context, making it clear which conditional branches lead to type errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Path-Aware Validation (`function_type.cljc`)

Updated `check-return-type!` to validate each execution path separately:

```clojure
;; BEFORE: Validated all samples together
(let [samples (::cp.art/samples type-description)]
  (check all samples against return-spec))

;; AFTER: Validate each path separately, track which fail
(let [paths (::cp.art/execution-paths type-description)
      failing-paths (keep (fn [path]
                           (when (some-sample-fails? path)
                             (assoc path ::cp.art/failing-sample failing-sample)))
                          paths)]
  (when (seq failing-paths)
    (record-error! with ::cp.art/failing-paths)))
```

**Key improvement:** Errors now include `::failing-paths` with full path information (conditions, branches, samples).

### 2. Path Formatting Helpers (`problem_formatter.cljc`)

Added four helper functions:

1. **`format-condition-expression`** - Strips meta-wrappers for clean display
2. **`format-path-condition`** - Formats single condition: `(< 8 n 11) → else`
3. **`format-path`** - Formats execution path with AND-joined conditions
4. **`format-failing-paths`** - Handles single or multiple failing paths

### 3. Updated Error Formatter

Enhanced `:error/bad-return-value` formatter to include path context:

```clojure
(defmethod format-problem-mm :error/bad-return-value [problem params]
  (let [failing-paths (get-in problem [::cp.art/actual ::cp.art/failing-paths])
        path-context (when (seq failing-paths) (format-failing-paths failing-paths))
        message-suffix (or path-context ".")]
    {:message (format "The Return spec is %s, but it is possible to return a value like %s%s"
                     (format-expected problem)
                     (format-actual problem)
                     message-suffix)
     ...}))
```

## Error Message Examples

### Single Failing Path
```
The Return spec is boolean?, but it is possible to return a value like 42 when (< 8 n 11) → else
```

Clear and concise - shows exactly which branch causes the error.

### Multiple Failing Paths
```
The Return spec is number?, but it is possible to return a value like "bad", 42 on 2 paths:
  • (pos? x) → then
  • (pos? x) → else
```

Lists all failing paths - helpful for understanding the full scope.

### Nested Conditions
```
The Return spec is number?, but it is possible to return a value like :bad when (pos? x) → then AND (even? x) → else
```

Shows the condition chain - perfect for nested ifs.

### Backward Compatibility
```
The Return spec is boolean?, but it is possible to return a value like 42.
```

Legacy errors without path information still work correctly.

## Testing

- ✅ **All existing tests pass:** 40 tests, 157 assertions, 0 failures
- ✅ **Manual review:** Tested all error message scenarios
- ✅ **Backward compatible:** Non-path-based errors format correctly
- ✅ **Zero regressions:** No existing functionality broken

## Files Modified

1. `src/main/com/fulcrologic/copilot/analysis/function_type.cljc`
   - Updated `check-return-type!` for path-aware validation
   
2. `src/main/com/fulcrologic/copilot/ui/problem_formatter.cljc`
   - Added path formatting helper functions
   - Updated `:error/bad-return-value` formatter

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Error messages clearly show which execution paths fail
- ✅ Single path: concise "when (condition) → branch" format
- ✅ Multiple paths: bullet list of all failing paths
- ✅ Nested conditions: AND-joined condition chains
- ✅ Backward compatible with legacy errors
- ✅ Zero test failures

## What's Next

Phase 5 completes the core path-based analysis implementation! The system now:
- Tracks execution paths through conditionals
- Partitions samples based on pure predicates
- Validates each path separately
- Reports errors with full path context

**Optional Phase 6:** Extend to `cond`, `case`, and other control flow constructs.
